Alignment Tool for large 3D-image data
=======================================

Affine alignment tool for large serial section / serial block-face EM image data developed at the Janelia Farm Research Campus. Designed for a Linux cluster with (Sun / Oracle / Univa) Grid Engine.

Please use the instructions in

Alignment_Projects / 00_DOC

to set it up on your cluster.

The generated per-image tile affine transformations can then be used with FijiBento to render eg a registered single tif image stack for further processing.
