Aligner
=======

### What it does well

**Stitches together any mode of serial section image data:**

- TEM
- Block-face SEM
- Fluorescence Array Tomography

**Fast and scalable:**

- Runs on linux cluster using Sun Grid Engine API
- Align 2 to billions of images
- Approx. linear time/volume & mem/volume scaling
- Two million 4MB images align in about 8 man-hours

**Handled pathologies:**

- Missing tiles or whole sections
- Fragmented / small / irregular sections
- Arbitrarily rotated/translated sections
- Burns, scars, foreign matter
- Exposure inhomogeneity

**Input:**

- 8 or 16 bit TIF, PNG, MRC
- Simple meta-data as text or TrakEM2 XML

**Output:**

- Basically 1 affine or homographic transform per image tile
- Flexible output as text tables or TrakEM2 XML files

### Limitations

- One linear transform / tile; **_not an elastic aligner_**
- Unfinished handling of geometry-altering folds and tears
- All images in a data set must be of same fixed dimensions

### Authorship

Developed over several years at **HHMI/Janelia Research Campus**, originally by **Louis Scheffer**, and subsequently refined into current form by **Bill Karsh**. See reference ["Automated Alignment of Imperfect EM Images for Neural Reconstruction"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6034).
