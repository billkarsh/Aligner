Here is the pe impi3 and attached are the start and stop scripts.  I think they are provided in the additional content for Univa for setting up a tightly integrated intel mpi parallel environment.

qconf -sp impi3

pe_name            impi3
slots              9999
user_lists         NONE
xuser_lists        NONE
start_proc_args    /sge/8.1.4/mpi/startmpi.sh -unique -catch_rsh $pe_hostfile
stop_proc_args     /sge/8.1.4/mpi/stopmpi.sh
allocation_rule    16
control_slaves     TRUE
job_is_first_task  FALSE
urgency_slots      min
accounting_summary FALSE


We changed the allocation rule so that it always gives entire nodes.  The caveat is that should be the total number of slots on a node and they will always have to request in increments of that number otherwise it will never be scheduled.

Best,
Rob
