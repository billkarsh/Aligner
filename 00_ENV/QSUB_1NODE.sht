# iclient is an index identifying the context from which this script
# has been called...It's used to select an execution time hint for
# the scheduler.
#
# stdoutfile names your stdout file. The empty string, "", selects
# /dev/null, which suppresses output.
#
# ierrfile is one of {0,1}. Zero joins stderr to stdout. One creates
# an error file named "<jobname>.err".
